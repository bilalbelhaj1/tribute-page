            <h2>Biography</h2>
             <p id="tribute-info">Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in london, England. He was a mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and computer scientist whose groundbreaking work laid the foundations for modern computing and artificial intelligence. <br> From a young age, turing demonstrated a naturale aptitude for mathematics and science. He attended King's College, Cambridge, where he excelled academically and became a fellow in 1935. <br> Turing was not just brilliant academic but also a visionary who foresaw the potential of computers long before anyone else.</p>

            <h2>World War II and the Enigma Machine</h2>
            <p>During World War II, Turing was recruited to work at Bletchley Park, teh British government's top-secret codebreaking center. <br>His most significant contribution was developing techniques to break the German Enigma machine, which encrypted military communications. <br>By 1941, Turing and his team had cracked Enigma, saving countless lives and shortening the war by several years.</p>

            <h2>The Turing Machine</h2>
            <p>
                In 1936, Turing introduced the concept of a theoretical computing device,now known as the "Turing Machine" This idea formed the foundation of computer science, demonstrating that a machine could compute anything that is computable, given enough time and resources. This concept is considered the basis of theoretical computer science.

            <h2>The Turing Test and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>
                In 1950, Turing published a landmark paper titled "Computing Machinery and intelligence" where he proposed what is now known as the <strong>Turing Test</strong>. <br> This test determines whether a machine can exhibit behavior indistinguishable from a human. <br> it remains a fundamental  concept in the field of <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, inspiring generations of researchers to develop machines that can "think"
